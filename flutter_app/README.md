## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].
Each feature module has the respective translations.


### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string to an existing module, just update the json file inside the specific feature_localizations module.

2. To create a new feature localization module, just follow the authentication example, attached to the repository. You'll need to update the ModuleLocalizationDelegate and LocalizationSDK Configuration (localizations_sdk\lib\src\i18n\configuration.dart - localizationsDelegates).


### Adding Supported Languages

1. For each supported locale, add a new one at LocalizationSDK Configuration (localizations_sdk\lib\src\i18n\configuration.dart - supportedLanguages).
